msgid ""
"The best way to make sure tickets do not get hung up on the way to checkin "

"确保工单在签入过程中不被挂起的最佳方法是让它变得非常易于理解问题并验证修复程"

msgid ""
"Does the patch include a unit test? If not, is there a very clear "

"shows that the patch actually fixes it."
msgstr ""
"补丁是否包括单元测试？如果没有，那么是否可以解释清楚原因？测试可以简洁地表达"
"了问题所在，并显示补丁真的修复了问题。"

msgid ""
"If your patch stands no chance of inclusion in Django, we won't ignore it -- "
"we'll just close the ticket. So if your ticket is still open, it doesn't "
"mean we're ignoring you; it just means we haven't had time to look at it yet."
msgstr ""
"如果你的补丁没有被加入到Django，并不意味我们忽视它了——我们只是关闭这个工单。"
"所以如果你的工单一直处于开启状态，也并不意味着我们忽视了你；这只是意味着我们"
"还没来得及看它。"

msgid "When and how might I remind the team of a patch I care about?"
msgstr "何时以及如何提醒团队我所关注的补丁？"

msgid ""
"A polite, well-timed message to the mailing list is one way to get "
"attention. To determine the right time, you need to keep an eye on the "
"schedule. If you post your message right before a release deadline, you're "
"not likely to get the sort of attention you require."
msgstr ""
"一种获得关注的方式是向邮件列表发送一个礼貌的，适时的消息。为了确保时间合适，"
"你需要留意时间表。如果你在发布截止日期之前发送消息，则不太可能获得您需要的关"

msgid ""
"Gentle IRC reminders can also work -- again, strategically timed if "
"possible. During a bug sprint would be a very good time, for example."
msgstr ""
"温和的IRC提醒也可以发挥作用——还是如此：如果可能的话，选取一个合适的时间。 例"
"如，在修复bug的冲刺期间就是一个不错的时机。"

msgid ""
"Another way to get traction is to pull several related tickets together. "
"When the someone sits down to review a bug in an area they haven't touched "
"for a while, it can take a few minutes to remember all the fine details of "
"how that area of code works. If you collect several minor bug fixes together "
"into a similarly themed group, you make an attractive target, as the cost of "
"coming up to speed on an area of code can be spread over multiple tickets."
msgstr ""
"另一种方法获得关注的方法是将几个相关的工单放在一起。当某人坐下来审阅一个他们"
"已经有一段时间没有接触的区域中的bug时，可能需要几分钟的时间来想起该区域代码如"
"何工作的所有细节。如果您将几个小错误的修复集中到一个类似主题的组中，那么您将"
"成为一个有吸引力的目标，因为在一个区域的代码上提速工作的成本可以被用到多个工"
"单上。"

msgid ""
"Please refrain from emailing anyone personally or repeatedly raising the "
"same issue over and over. This sort of behavior will not gain you any "
"additional attention -- certainly not the attention that you need in order "
"to get your issue addressed."
msgstr ""
"请不要通过电子邮件向任何人发邮件或反复提出同样的问题。 这种行为不会让你有任何"
"额外的关注——当然也不会给你带来解决问题所需的关注。"

msgid "But I've reminded you several times and you keep ignoring my patch!"
msgstr "但是我已经提醒你好几遍了，你依然继续忽略我的补丁！"

msgid ""
"Seriously - we're not ignoring you. If your patch stands no chance of "
"inclusion in Django, we'll close the ticket. For all the other tickets, we "
"need to prioritize our efforts, which means that some tickets will be "
"addressed before others."
msgstr ""
"说真的 - 我们不会无视你的。 如果你的补丁没有包含在Django的工单，我们将关闭工"
"单。 对于所有其他的工单，我们需要优先考虑我们的努力，这意味着一些工单将在其他"
"人之前解决。"

msgid ""
"One of the criteria that is used to prioritize bug fixes is the number of "
"people that will likely be affected by a given bug. Bugs that have the "
"potential to affect many people will generally get priority over those that "
"are edge cases."
msgstr ""
"确定bug修复优先级的标准之一是对于特定bug而言，可能会受到影响的人数。有可能影"
"响许多人的bug一般会优先于那些边缘情况下的bug。"

msgid ""
"Another reason that bugs might be ignored for while is if the bug is a "
"symptom of a larger problem. While we can spend time writing, testing and "
"applying lots of little patches, sometimes the right solution is to rebuild. "
"If a rebuild or refactor of a particular component has been proposed or is "
"underway, you may find that bugs affecting that component will not get as "
"much attention. Again, this is just a matter of prioritizing scarce "
"resources. By concentrating on the rebuild, we can close all the little bugs "
"at once, and hopefully prevent other little bugs from appearing in the "
"future."
msgstr ""
"错误可能会被忽略的另一个原因是，如果错误是一个更大的问题的表现。 虽然我们可以"
"花时间编写，测试和应用大量的小补丁，但有时候正确的解决方案是重建。 如果某个特"
"定组件的重建或重构已经提出或正在进行中，那么您可能会发现影响该组件的错误不会"
"得到太多关注。 再次，这只是优先考虑稀缺资源的问题。 通过集中重建，我们可以一"
"次性关闭所有的 BUG，并且希望能够防止未来出现其他小 BUG。"

msgid ""
"Whatever the reason, please keep in mind that while you may hit a particular "
"bug regularly, it doesn't necessarily follow that every single Django user "
"will hit the same bug. Different users use Django in different ways, "
"stressing different parts of the code under different conditions. When we "
"evaluate the relative priorities, we are generally trying to consider the "
"needs of the entire community, not just the severity for one particular "
"user. This doesn't mean that we think your problem is unimportant -- just "
"that in the limited time we have available, we will always err on the side "
"of making 10 people happy rather than making 1 person happy."
msgstr ""
"不管什么原因，请记住，你可能会经常碰到一个特定的 bug，但并不一定每个Django用 "
"户都会遇到同样的 bug。 不同的用户以不同的方式使用 Django，在不同的条件下执行"
"代码的不同部分。 我们评估相对优先事项时，会考虑整个社区的需求，而不仅仅是一个"
"特定用户的问题严重程度。 当然，这并不意味着我们认为你的问题不重要，只是在有限"
"的可用时间内，我们总是希望让 10 个人的问题得到解决，而不是只解决 1 个人的问"
