msgid "How can I get started contributing code to Django?"
msgstr "제가 Django의 코드에 기여하려면 어떻게 해야할까요?"

msgid ""
"I submitted a bug fix in the ticket system several weeks ago. Why are you "
"ignoring my patch?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Don't worry: We're not ignoring you!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's important to understand there is a difference between \"a ticket is "
"being ignored\" and \"a ticket has not been attended to yet.\" Django's "
"ticket system contains hundreds of open tickets, of various degrees of "
"impact on end-user functionality, and Django's developers have to review and "
"prioritize."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On top of that: the people who work on Django are all volunteers. As a "
"result, the amount of time that we have to work on the framework is limited "
"and will vary from week to week depending on our spare time. If we're busy, "
"we may not be able to spend as much time on Django as we might want."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The best way to make sure tickets do not get hung up on the way to checkin "
"is to make it dead easy, even for someone who may not be intimately familiar "
"with that area of the code, to understand the problem and verify the fix:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Are there clear instructions on how to reproduce the bug? If this touches a "
"dependency (such as Pillow), a contrib module, or a specific database, are "
"those instructions clear enough even for someone not familiar with it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there are several patches attached to the ticket, is it clear what each "
"one does, which ones can be ignored and which matter?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Does the patch include a unit test? If not, is there a very clear "
"explanation why not? A test expresses succinctly what the problem is, and "
"shows that the patch actually fixes it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your patch stands no chance of inclusion in Django, we won't ignore it -- "
"we'll just close the ticket. So if your ticket is still open, it doesn't "
"mean we're ignoring you; it just means we haven't had time to look at it yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "When and how might I remind the team of a patch I care about?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A polite, well-timed message to the mailing list is one way to get "
"attention. To determine the right time, you need to keep an eye on the "
"schedule. If you post your message right before a release deadline, you're "
"not likely to get the sort of attention you require."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gentle IRC reminders can also work -- again, strategically timed if "
"possible. During a bug sprint would be a very good time, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another way to get traction is to pull several related tickets together. "
"When the someone sits down to review a bug in an area they haven't touched "
"for a while, it can take a few minutes to remember all the fine details of "
"how that area of code works. If you collect several minor bug fixes together "
"into a similarly themed group, you make an attractive target, as the cost of "
"coming up to speed on an area of code can be spread over multiple tickets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please refrain from emailing anyone personally or repeatedly raising the "
"same issue over and over. This sort of behavior will not gain you any "
"additional attention -- certainly not the attention that you need in order "
"to get your issue addressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "But I've reminded you several times and you keep ignoring my patch!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Seriously - we're not ignoring you. If your patch stands no chance of "
"inclusion in Django, we'll close the ticket. For all the other tickets, we "
"need to prioritize our efforts, which means that some tickets will be "
"addressed before others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the criteria that is used to prioritize bug fixes is the number of "
"people that will likely be affected by a given bug. Bugs that have the "
"potential to affect many people will generally get priority over those that "
"are edge cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another reason that bugs might be ignored for while is if the bug is a "
"symptom of a larger problem. While we can spend time writing, testing and "
"applying lots of little patches, sometimes the right solution is to rebuild. "
"If a rebuild or refactor of a particular component has been proposed or is "
"underway, you may find that bugs affecting that component will not get as "
"much attention. Again, this is just a matter of prioritizing scarce "
"resources. By concentrating on the rebuild, we can close all the little bugs "
"at once, and hopefully prevent other little bugs from appearing in the "
"future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whatever the reason, please keep in mind that while you may hit a particular "
"bug regularly, it doesn't necessarily follow that every single Django user "
"will hit the same bug. Different users use Django in different ways, "
"stressing different parts of the code under different conditions. When we "
"evaluate the relative priorities, we are generally trying to consider the "
"needs of the entire community, not just the severity for one particular "
"user. This doesn't mean that we think your problem is unimportant -- just "
"that in the limited time we have available, we will always err on the side "
"of making 10 people happy rather than making 1 person happy."

msgid "FAQ: General"
msgstr ""

msgid "Why does this project exist?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django grew from a very practical need: World Online, a newspaper Web "
"operation, is responsible for building intensive Web applications on "
"journalism deadlines. In the fast-paced newsroom, World Online often has "
"only a matter of hours to take a complicated Web application from concept to "
"public launch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the same time, the World Online Web developers have consistently been "
"perfectionists when it comes to following best practices of Web development."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In fall 2003, the World Online developers (Adrian Holovaty and Simon "
"Willison) ditched PHP and began using Python to develop its websites. As "
"they built intensive, richly interactive sites such as Lawrence.com, they "
"began to extract a generic Web development framework that let them build Web "
"applications more and more quickly. They tweaked this framework constantly, "
"adding improvements over two years."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In summer 2005, World Online decided to open-source the resulting software, "
"Django. Django would not be possible without a whole host of open-source "
"projects -- `Apache`_, `Python`_, and `PostgreSQL`_ to name a few -- and "
"we're thrilled to be able to give something back to the open-source "
"community."
msgstr ""

msgid "What does \"Django\" mean, and how do you pronounce it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django is named after `Django Reinhardt`_, a jazz manouche guitarist from "
"the 1930s to early 1950s. To this day, he's considered one of the best "
"guitarists of all time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Listen to his music. You'll like it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django is pronounced **JANG**-oh. Rhymes with FANG-oh. The \"D\" is silent."
msgstr ""

msgid "We've also recorded an `audio clip of the pronunciation`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is Django stable?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes, it's quite stable. Companies like Disqus, Instagram, Pinterest, and "
"Mozilla have been using Django for many years. Sites built on Django have "
"weathered traffic spikes of over 50 thousand hits per second."
msgstr ""

msgid "Does Django scale?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes. Compared to development time, hardware is cheap, and so Django is "
"designed to take advantage of as much hardware as you can throw at it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django uses a \"shared-nothing\" architecture, which means you can add "
"hardware at any level -- database servers, caching servers or Web/"
"application servers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The framework cleanly separates components such as its database layer and "
"application layer. And it ships with a simple-yet-powerful :doc:`cache "
"framework </topics/cache>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who's behind this?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django was originally developed at World Online, the Web department of a "
"newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, USA. Django's now run by an international "
"`team of volunteers <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Which sites use Django?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`DjangoSites.org`_ features a constantly growing list of Django-powered "
"sites."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Django appears to be a MVC framework, but you call the Controller the \"view"
"\", and the View the \"template\". How come you don't use the standard names?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Well, the standard names are debatable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In our interpretation of MVC, the \"view\" describes the data that gets "
"presented to the user. It's not necessarily *how* the data *looks*, but "
"*which* data is presented. The view describes *which data you see*, not *how "
"you see it.* It's a subtle distinction."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So, in our case, a \"view\" is the Python callback function for a particular "
"URL, because that callback function describes which data is presented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Furthermore, it's sensible to separate content from presentation -- which is "
"where templates come in. In Django, a \"view\" describes which data is "
"presented, but a view normally delegates to a template, which describes "
"*how* the data is presented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Where does the \"controller\" fit in, then? In Django's case, it's probably "
"the framework itself: the machinery that sends a request to the appropriate "
"view, according to the Django URL configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're hungry for acronyms, you might say that Django is a \"MTV\" "
"framework -- that is, \"model\", \"template\", and \"view.\" That breakdown "
"makes much more sense."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At the end of the day, of course, it comes down to getting stuff done. And, "
"regardless of how things are named, Django gets stuff done in a way that's "
"most logical to us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<Framework X> does <feature Y> -- why doesn't Django?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We're well aware that there are other awesome Web frameworks out there, and "
"we're not averse to borrowing ideas where appropriate. However, Django was "
"developed precisely because we were unhappy with the status quo, so please "
"be aware that \"because <Framework X> does it\" is not going to be "
"sufficient reason to add a given feature to Django."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Why did you write all of Django from scratch, instead of using other Python "
"libraries?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Django was originally written, Adrian and Simon spent quite a bit of "
"time exploring the various Python Web frameworks available."
msgstr ""

msgid "In our opinion, none of them were completely up to snuff."
msgstr ""

msgid "We're picky. You might even call us perfectionists. (With deadlines.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Over time, we stumbled across open-source libraries that did things we'd "
"already implemented. It was reassuring to see other people solving similar "
"problems in similar ways, but it was too late to integrate outside code: "
"We'd already written, tested and implemented our own framework bits in "
"several production settings -- and our own code met our needs delightfully."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most cases, however, we found that existing frameworks/tools inevitably "
"had some sort of fundamental, fatal flaw that made us squeamish. No tool fit "
"our philosophies 100%."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like we said: We're picky."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We've documented our philosophies on the :doc:`design philosophies page </"
"misc/design-philosophies>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is Django a content-management-system (CMS)?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"No, Django is not a CMS, or any sort of \"turnkey product\" in and of "
"itself. It's a Web framework; it's a programming tool that lets you build "
"websites."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, it doesn't make much sense to compare Django to something like "
"Drupal_, because Django is something you use to *create* things like Drupal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, Django's automatic admin site is fantastic and timesaving -- but "
"the admin site is one module of Django the framework. Furthermore, although "
"Django has special conveniences for building \"CMS-y\" apps, that doesn't "
"mean it's not just as appropriate for building \"non-CMS-y\" apps (whatever "
"that means!)."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can I download the Django documentation to read it offline?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Django docs are available in the ``docs`` directory of each Django "
"tarball release. These docs are in reST (reStructuredText) format, and each "
"text file corresponds to a Web page on the official Django site."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because the documentation is `stored in revision control`_, you can browse "
"documentation changes just like you can browse code changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Technically, the docs on Django's site are generated from the latest "
"development versions of those reST documents, so the docs on the Django site "
"may offer more information than the docs that come with the latest Django "
"release."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I cite Django?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's difficult to give an official citation format, for two reasons: "
"citation formats can vary wildly between publications, and citation "
"standards for software are still a matter of some debate."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, `APA style`_,  would dictate something like::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, the only true guide is what your publisher will accept, so get a "

"Django requires Python. See the table in the next question for the versions "
"of Python that work with each version of Django. Other Python libraries may "
"be required for some uses, but you'll receive an error about it as they're "
"needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a development environment -- if you just want to experiment with Django "
"-- you don't need to have a separate Web server installed; Django comes with "
"its own lightweight development server. For a production environment, Django "
"follows the WSGI spec, :pep:`3333`, which means it can run on a variety of "
"server platforms. See :doc:`Deploying Django </howto/deployment/index>` for "
"some popular alternatives."

msgid ""
"If you want to use Django with a database, which is probably the case, "
"you'll also need a database engine. PostgreSQL_ is recommended, because "
"we're PostgreSQL fans, and MySQL_, `SQLite 3`_, and Oracle_ are also "
"supported."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Typically, we will support a Python version up to and including the first "
"Django LTS release whose security support ends after security support for "
"that version of Python ends. For example, Python 3.3 security support ends "
"September 2017 and Django 1.8 LTS security support ends April 2018. "
"Therefore Django 1.8 is the last version to support Python 3.3."
msgstr ""

msgid "What Python version should I use with Django?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As of Django 1.6, Python 3 support is considered stable and you can safely "
"use it in production. See also :doc:`/topics/python3`. However, the "
"community is still in the process of migrating third-party packages and "
"applications to Python 3."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're starting a new project, and the dependencies you plan to use work "
"on Python 3, you should use Python 3. If they don't, consider contributing "
"to the porting efforts, or stick to Python 2."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since newer versions of Python are often faster, have more features, and are "
"better supported, all else being equal, we recommend that you use the latest "
"2.x.y or 3.x.y release."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You don't lose anything in Django by using an older release, but you don't "
"take advantage of the improvements and optimizations in newer Python "
"releases. Third-party applications for use with Django are, of course, free "
"to set their own version requirements."
msgstr ""

msgid "Should I use the stable version or development version?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generally, if you're using code in production, you should be using a stable "
"release. The Django project publishes a full stable release every nine "
"months or so, with bugfix updates in between. These stable releases contain "
"the API that is covered by our backwards compatibility guarantees; if you "
"write code against stable releases, you shouldn't have any problems "
"upgrading when the next official version is released."

msgid "How can I see the raw SQL queries Django is running?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make sure your Django :setting:`DEBUG` setting is set to ``True``. Then, "
"just do this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``connection.queries`` is only available if :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True``. "
"It's a list of dictionaries in order of query execution. Each dictionary has "
"the following::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``connection.queries`` includes all SQL statements -- INSERTs, UPDATES, "
"SELECTs, etc. Each time your app hits the database, the query will be "

msgid ""
"If you are using :doc:`multiple databases</topics/db/multi-db>`, you can use "

msgid "Can I use Django with a pre-existing database?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes. See :doc:`Integrating with a legacy database </howto/legacy-databases>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "If I make changes to a model, how do I update the database?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take a look at Django's support for :mod:`schema migrations <django.db."
"migrations>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't mind clearing data, your project's ``manage.py`` utility has a :"
"djadmin:`flush` option to reset the database to the state it was in "
"immediately after :djadmin:`migrate` was executed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do Django models support multiple-column primary keys?"
msgstr ""

msgid "No. Only single-column primary keys are supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But this isn't an issue in practice, because there's nothing stopping you "
"from adding other constraints (using the ``unique_together`` model option or "
"creating the constraint directly in your database), and enforcing the "
"uniqueness at that level. Single-column primary keys are needed for things "
"such as the admin interface to work; e.g., you need a simple way of being "
"able to specify an object to edit or delete."
msgstr ""

msgid "Does Django support NoSQL databases?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NoSQL databases are not officially supported by Django itself. There are, "
"however, a number of side project and forks which allow NoSQL functionality "
"in Django, like `Django non-rel`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also take a look on `the wiki page`_ which discusses some "
"alternatives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"How do I add database-specific options to my CREATE TABLE statements, such "
"as specifying MyISAM as the table type?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We try to avoid adding special cases in the Django code to accommodate all "
"the database-specific options such as table type, etc. If you'd like to use "
"any of these options, create a migration with a :class:`~django.db."
"migrations.operations.RunSQL` operation that contains ``ALTER TABLE`` "
"statements that do what you want to do."

msgid ""
"The environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is set to a fully-qualified "

"Said module is on ``sys.path`` (``import mysite.settings`` should work)."

msgid "I can't stand your template language. Do I have to use it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We happen to think our template engine is the best thing since chunky bacon, "
"but we recognize that choosing a template language runs close to religion. "
"There's nothing about Django that requires using the template language, so "

msgid "Do I have to use your model/database layer?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Nope. Just like the template system, the model/database layer is decoupled "
"from the rest of the framework."

msgid ""
"The one exception is: If you use a different database library, you won't get "

msgid ""
"Using a :class:`~django.db.models.FileField` or an :class:`~django.db.models."
"ImageField` in a model takes a few steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In your settings file, you'll need to define :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` as the "
"full path to a directory where you'd like Django to store uploaded files. "
"(For performance, these files are not stored in the database.) Define :"
"setting:`MEDIA_URL` as the base public URL of that directory. Make sure that "
"this directory is writable by the Web server's user account."

msgid ""
"Add the :class:`~django.db.models.FileField` or :class:`~django.db.models."

"for uploaded files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All that will be stored in your database is a path to the file (relative to :"
"setting:`MEDIA_ROOT`). You'll most likely want to use the convenience :attr:"
"`~django.db.models.fields.files.FieldFile.url` attribute provided by Django. "
"For example, if your :class:`~django.db.models.ImageField` is called "
"``mug_shot``, you can get the absolute path to your image in a template with "
"``{{ object.mug_shot.url }}``."

msgid "How do I make a variable available to all my templates?"

msgid ""
"Sometimes your templates just all need the same thing. A common example "
