No modo embutido, mod_wsgi é similar ao mod_perl -- ele embuti Python dentro do Apache e carrega o código Python na memória quando o servidor inicia. O código permanece na memória durante a vida do processo Apache, o que leva a significativos ganhos de performance se comparado com outros arranjos de servidores. No modo \"deamon\", mod_wsgi desova um processo \"deamon\" independente que lida com as requisições. O processo \"deamon\" pode rodar com um usuário diferente do usuário do servidor Web, possivelmente levando a uma melhora de segurança, e o processo \"deamon\" pode ser reiniciado sem ter que reiniciar todo o servidor web Apache, possivelmente fazendo com que o a atualização do seu código seja menos penoso.Consulte a documentação do mod_wsgi para determinar qual modo é correto para sua instalação. Assegure-se  de ter o Apache instalado, com o módulo mod_wsgi ativado. O Django irá trabahar com qualquer versao do Apache que de suporte a mod_wsgi."
